# Research Report: Machine Learning in Healthcare

## Hypothesis

Can Machine Learning in Healthcare consistently achieve 20.0%+ efficiency with ML?

## Findings

Analysis of 5 records: avg efficiency 20.0%, efficiency model (R�=0.97) predicts 21.5% for 14 hours, outcome model (R�=0.98) predicts 90.9% improvement. Recommendation: Increase training hours to 14+ for optimal efficiency and outcomes.

## Conclusion

Promising results warrant further study.
