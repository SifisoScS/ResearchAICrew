Research Report: Machine Learning in Healthcare
Hypothesis: Can Machine Learning in Healthcare improve efficiency by 20% using advanced ML techniques?
Findings: Analysis of 5 records shows average 20.0% efficiency gain. Linear model (R²=0.97) predicts 21.5% gain for 14 training hours.
Conclusion: Promising results warrant further study.
