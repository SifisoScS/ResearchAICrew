White Paper: Prostate cancer - Detailed analysis and future directions.

# Research Report: Prostate cancer

## Hypothesis
Can Prostate cancer consistently achieve 20.0%+ efficiency with ML?

## Findings
Analysis of 5 records: avg efficiency 20.0%, avg cost reduction 6.3%, avg survival rate 92.2% (prostate-specific), NN predicts efficiency 20.7% for 14 hours, NN predicts outcome 34.2% improvement. Recommendation: Increase training hours to 14+ for optimal efficiency and outcomes.

## Conclusion
Promising results warrant further study.
