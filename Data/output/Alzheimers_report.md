# Research Report: Alzheimers

## Hypothesis

Can Alzheimers consistently achieve 20.0%+ efficiency with ML?

## Findings

Analysis of 5 records: avg efficiency 20.0%, avg cost reduction 6.3%, efficiency DT (R�=1.00) predicts 21.0% for 14 hours, outcome DT (R�=1.00) predicts 90.0% improvement. Recommendation: Increase training hours to 14+ for optimal efficiency and outcomes.

## Conclusion

Promising results warrant further study.
