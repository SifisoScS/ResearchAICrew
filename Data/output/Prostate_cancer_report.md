# Research Report: Prostate cancer

## Hypothesis

Can Prostate cancer consistently achieve 20.0%+ efficiency with ML?

## Findings

Analysis of 5 records: avg efficiency 20.0%, avg cost reduction 6.3%, avg survival rate 92.2% (prostate-specific), NN predicts efficiency 9.2% for 14 hours, NN predicts outcome 27.8% improvement. Recommendation: Optimize current training process.

## Conclusion

Promising results warrant further study.
