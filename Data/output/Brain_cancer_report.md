# Research Report: Brain cancer

## Hypothesis
Can Brain cancer consistently achieve 20.0%+ efficiency with ML?

## Findings
Analysis of 5 records: avg efficiency 20.0%, avg cost reduction 6.3%, avg survival rate 0.0% (prostate-specific), NN predicts efficiency 21.5% for 14 hours, NN predicts outcome 91.0% improvement. Recommendation: Increase training hours to 14+ for optimal efficiency and outcomes.

## Conclusion
Promising results warrant further study.
