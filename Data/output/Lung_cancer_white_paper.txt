White Paper: Lung cancer - Detailed analysis and future directions.

# Research Report: Lung cancer

## Hypothesis
Can Lung cancer consistently achieve 22.0%+ efficiency with ML?

## Findings
Analysis of 5 records: avg efficiency 22.0%, avg cost reduction 6.3%, efficiency DT (R²=1.00) predicts 23.1% for 14 hours, outcome DT (R²=1.00) predicts 94.5% improvement. Recommendation: Increase training hours to 14+ for optimal efficiency and outcomes.

## Conclusion
Promising results warrant further study.
