# Research Report: AI in Healthcare

## Hypothesis
Can AI in Healthcare consistently achieve 20.0%+ efficiency with ML?

## Findings
Analysis of 5 records: avg efficiency 20.0%, efficiency model (R²=0.97) predicts 21.5% for 14 hours, outcome model (R²=0.98) predicts 90.9% improvement. Recommendation: Increase training hours to 14+ for optimal efficiency and outcomes.

## Conclusion
Promising results warrant further study.
